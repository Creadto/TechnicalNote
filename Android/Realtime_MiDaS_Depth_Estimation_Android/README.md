* [Official MiDaS GitHub repo](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS)
* [TFLite model on TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/intel/midas/v2_1_small/1)
* [APK for this project](https://github.com/shubham0204/Realtime_MiDaS_Depth_Estimation_Android/raw/master/app.apk)

The repository contains an Android project which uses the [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) model to perform monocular
depth estimation. You can find the official Android example here -> https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/tree/master/mobile/android

This project uses the TFLite model from the [MiDaS's TensorFlow Hub repo](https://tfhub.dev/intel/midas/v2_1_small/1).
The following features are included in the project,

1. Well documented code with links to SO answers wherever required.
2. Uses latest APIs like [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax) and [Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines).
3. No use of heavy packages like OpenCV to process and display the depth map. The application is coded in a
*Android* friendly manner.
4. Works for both front and rear camera and also in portrait and landscape orientations.
